#Android app for studying
This was created for a project during my bachelor's studies. It is an Android app in Java called Study Cards, that quizzes the user on a specific topic and shows the correct and/or wrong answers at the end etc. A database was used as well to fetch the questions and the answers, as well as the users since the app also features a log in screen.
